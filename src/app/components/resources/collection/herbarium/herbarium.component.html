      <p class="atlas-light banner-content" style="line-height: 1.3;">
        Established in the early 1970s, the Gregorio T. Velasquez Phycological Herbarium (MSI) is witness to the diversity of Philippine seaweeds and seagrass. It was built through the efforts of Dr. Gavino C. Trono, Jr. as a tribute to his mentor, the late National Scientist Dr. Gregorio T. Velasquez. With over 55,000 voucher specimens, the Herbarium is the largest collection of benthic marine macroalgae and seagrass both in the Philippines and in the ASEAN region.

      <p class="right-content-p">Dr. Velasquez' legacy revolves around promoting awareness and conservation of algae. The MSI Herbarium aims to implement that through education, archiving, research, and resource management. It showcases the collection of Philippine seaweeds and seagrass to foreign and local visitors, serves as a repository for type specimens and voucher specimens published in the literature, and services the needs of individuals doing in-depth taxonomic and biodiversity studies. Of the ~55,000 voucher specimens, 93% were obtained locally, while 7% were collected from other countries. These specimens belong to 500 genera of 2,100 species. </p>

      <p class="atlas-light">The MSI Herbarium comprises 46% Rhodophyta (red algae),  20% Chlorophyta (green algae), 18% Ochrophyta (brown algae), 9% Cyanophyta (blue-green algae), and 7% minor groups. About 290 collections were gathered before the 20th century. Of these, the oldest collection features the coralline alga <em>Mesophyllum conchatum</em> (Setchell & Foslie) W.H. Adey obtained in 1750 from Dillon's Beach in Marine County, California, USA.</p>

        <!-- <p class="atlas-bold sub-title" style="color: #384e8a;">JOSELYN O. RAZAL</p> -->
        <p class="right-content-p atlas-light">Dr. Gregorio T. Velasquez was a Professor Emeritus of Botany of the University of the Philippines. He led the scientific progress of Philippine phycology with his dedication to collecting and archiving freshwater and marine algae. His 1986 publication, <em>Blue-green algae of the Philippines</em>, contains descriptions and geographical and ecological distributions of 162 species and varieties of cyanophytes. His body of work includes 42 basic and 77 scientific papers on the subject. Dr. Velasquez is widely recognized for his contributions to phycology and has been honored with five eponymous taxa of freshwater and marine algae. </p>
        <p class="right-content-p atlas-light">The multi-awarded National Academy of Science and Technology (NAST) Academician served as Chairman for Biological Sciences of the National Research Council of the Philippines and Department Chairman of the Department of Botany in the University of the Philippines. In 1982, he was recognized as a National Scientist.</p>

        <!-- <p class="atlas-bold sub-title" style="color: #384e8a;">JOSELYN O. RAZAL</p> -->
        <p class="right-content-p atlas-light">Dr. Gavino C. Trono, Jr. has dedicated much of his professional life to studying the many facets of tropical seaweeds, particularly their biodiversity (taxonomy), biology, ecology and cultivation. While in the academe, he led 45 projects in tropical marine phycology and published 142 related papers. Dr. Trono is also one of the most prolific seaweed taxonomists of his generation, having described 24 seaweed taxa that are new to science. His book <em>Field Guide</em> and <em>Atlas of the Seaweed Resources of the Philippines</em> is regarded highly by local and foreign phycologists, as well as other stakeholders of the Philippine seaweed industry. Currently, two seaweeds are named after Dr. Trono: the red seaweed <em>Chondrophycus tronoi</em> (Ganzon-Fortes) K.W. Nam and the brown algal genus <em>Tronoella</em> Santiañez & Kogame. </p>
        <p class="right-content-p atlas-light">Dr. Trono’s work has given scientists a deeper understanding of the geographical distribution of benthic algae in the Pacific region. Meanwhile, his work on the development of tropical seaweed farming, especially for the mass production of the carrageenan-producing seaweeds <em>Kappaphycus</em> and <em>Eucheuma</em>—the base of the Philippine seaweed industry—earned him the title of “Father of <em>Kappaphycus</em> farming.”  For this and other achievements, he was conferred the titles of Academician by NAST in 2008 and as National Scientist in 2014. At present, he is also a Professor Emeritus of UPMSI and actively works on the development of several economically important yet underutilized seaweeds such as the brown seaweeds <em>Sargassum</em> spp. and the red seaweed <em>Halymenia durvillei</em>.</p>
