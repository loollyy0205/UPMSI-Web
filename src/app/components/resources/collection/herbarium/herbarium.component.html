      <p class="atlas-light banner-content" style="line-height: 1.3;">
        Established in the early 1970s, the G.T. Velasquez Phycological Herbarium is witness to the diversity of Philippine seaweeds and seagrass. It was built through the efforts of Dr. Gavino Trono, Jr. as a tribute to the late National Scientist Dr. Gregorio T. Velasquez. With over 55,000 voucher specimens, the Herbarium is the largest collection of marine macrobenthic algae and seagrass both in the Philippines and in the ASEAN region.

      <p class="right-content-p">Dr. Velasquezâ€™ legacy revolves around promoting awareness and conservation of algae. The Herbarium aims to implement that through education, archiving, research, and resource management. It showcases the collection of Philippine seaweeds and seagrass to foreign and local visitors, serves as a depository for type specimens and voucher specimens published in the literature, and services the needs of individuals doing in-depth taxonomic and biodiversity studies. Of the 55,000 voucher specimens, 93% were obtained locally, while 7% were collected from other countries. These specimens belong to 500 genera of 2,100 species.  The Herbarium </p>
