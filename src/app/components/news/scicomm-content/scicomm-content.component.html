      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool">In the Earth's oceans, various life forms experience dwindling populations, leading to decreased marine biodiversity. Scientists worldwide persist in improving current conservation practices as our situation demands for more radical solutions to the biodiversity problem that arises from exploitation, pollution, and climate change. </p>
      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool">One key component of marine conservation research is the monitoring of indicators related to biodiversity and ecosystem health, like changes in the physical properties of ocean water or the abundance of a certain organism.1 Through monitoring activities, researchers generate sizeable databases of information — such extensive undertakings can be overwhelming and beyond the scope of available manpower. A viable solution is to employ citizen science, which can be loosely defined as the participation of volunteers in the collection (and, occasionally, analysis) of scientific data. <br><br>Jeremiah Requilme, a UP MSI graduate student and research associate of the Coral Reef Ecology Laboratory (CoRE, headed by <a href="http://www.msi.upd.edu.ph/Research/laboratories/coral-reef-ecology-laboratory" style="color: #384e8a"> Dr. Patrick Cabaitan</a>), and colleagues published in 2020 the article, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S096456912030421X" target="_blank" style="color: #384e8a">"Using citizen science and survey data to determine the recruitment envelope of the endangered giant clam species, Tridacna gigas (Cardiidae: Tridacninae),"</a> which explores the fruitful outcomes of involving people outside the STEM profession in the data gathering process. In 2017, Requilme and the team set out to a marine protected area (MPA) in Cantaan, Guinsiliban, Camiguin Island to perform a field survey on the number and sizes of T. gigas recruits in the area. <br><br> The article reports 26 T. gigas recruits found 0.2—2.3 km from the clam restocking site, with the field survey returning a count of three recruits. This value is far from the accumulated number of T. gigas recruit sightings reported by the fisherfolk, which totals 23 recruits over a two-year monitoring period. Fishers assist the Cantaan Centennial Multi-purpose Cooperative (CCMPC) in keeping record of the clams. This difference in tally emphasizes the need for citizen science in large-scale and long-term monitoring efforts. <br><br> </p>
       <p class="atlas-light location-content" style="font-size: 22px;" *ngIf="giantclamBool">Luck-driven survival</p>
       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool">Once in a while, when temporal and environmental conditions are optimal, the hermaphroditic T. gigas clams simultaneously release eggs and sperm (reproductive cells or “gametes”) into the water column through a process called spawning. The gametes released by an individual would trigger spawning of neighbouring giant clams in a reef and thereafter, fertilization. Successful fertilization happens when gametes are fertilized by nearby giant clams. <br> <br> When fertilized gametes reach the planktonic larval stage, they stay afloat for eight to nine days in the water column, where they are at the mercy of the ocean currents. During this period, they search for suitable habitats or substrates. By the time giant clam larvae have selected and settled onto substrates, they are regarded as "recruits". <br><br> Chance plays a huge role in the propagation of giant clams, but there is another factor that gravely limits their growth: overharvesting. Years of poaching and predation have caused the numbers of T. gigas to decrease to the point of near-extinction. Native to the Indo-Pacific region, these giant clams are critical members of reef ecosystems, acting as food, shelter to fish, and reef builders. </p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool">Giant clam recruitment and the recruitment envelope
       Naturally, we had to know: how are the giant clams today? Requilme tells us in an interview, "Right now, we have hundreds of thousands [of giant clams]. Most of these are restocked or produced through mariculture in the Bolinao Marine Laboratory (BML). During the 1980s, locally extinct sila. In most of the Philippine sites, wala nang nahanap, except Palawan (i.e., Cagayancillo Islands), Quezon (i.e., Polillo Islands), and Occidental Mindoro (i.e., Ambil Island). Doon lang ‘yung may natural and wild populations sila, pero one or two individuals lang ang nakita sa mga sites na ito." ("During the 1980s, they were locally extinct. In most of the Philippine sites, none could be found, except Palawan (i.e., Cagayancillo Islands), Quezon (i.e., Polillo Islands), and Occidental Mindoro (i.e., Ambil Island). There, giant clams have natural and wild populations, but only one or two individuals were observed in each site.") </p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool">The drastic decrease in giant clam population in the 1980s pushed marine scientists to initiate local conservation efforts. Apart from restocking and reintroducing giant clams in different sites around the Philippines, they monitored the giant clam populations. Not only that — they began to track the locations of recruits as well, a procedure that provides insight on the geographical scope, or “envelope,” of the recruitment process. Determining the recruitment envelope can help scientists come up with better conservation measures; that is, to identify possible factors or parameters to modify or control in order to circumvent the environmental restrictions of the natural recruitment process. However, tracing the locations of recruits is a "logistical nightmare," Requilme says. "Hindi mo madali ma-trace kung saan sila pupunta." (You can't easily trace where they would go.") <br><br> Scientists locate recruits through field surveys. In this study, Requilme and colleagues set up six survey sites having a 1,000 m2 total area coverage. The field survey was conducted in January and April 2017, and the team was able to record the coordinates and sizes of three recruits. </p>
       <p class="atlas-light location-content" style="font-size: 22px;" *ngIf="giantclamBool">Fishers as citizen scientists</p>
       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool">The locals in Cantaan, a coastal barangay in Camiguin Island, know how integral giant clams are to the health of the ocean. In 1999, the CCMPC established a 3000 m2 MPA that could serve as a sanctuary for giant clams. When recruits emerged in 2008, the CCMPC encouraged fisherfolk to report sightings while on their fishing routes. Many recruits were lost to poaching and predation, so the CCMPC began transferring them to a nursery in 2015.</p>

  <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool"> The fishers reported 23 sightings of giant clam recruits from 2015 to 2017. Compared to the result of the field survey, this number is almost eight times larger. We asked Requilme's insight on this disparity, to which he responded: <br><br>"Fishers, in contrast to researchers... Every day silang lumalabas para mangisda. More time sila sa reefs at livelihood nila 'to. They could have more opportunities [to record recruit sightings]. I can assume na most of these are accidental encounters lang. They’re familiar with the collaborating agency at doon na nila binibigay. Iyon 'yung main factor bakit ang laki ng discrepancy namin." ("They go out daily to fish. They have more time in the reefs and this is their livelihood. [...] I can assume that most of these are only accidental encounters. They're familiar with the collaborating agency and that is where they submit their findings. That's the main factor explaining why the discrepancy is so large.")</p>
       <p class="atlas-light location-content" style="font-size: 22px;" *ngIf="giantclamBool">Advocating for citizen science</p>
       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool">Does the determined range of 0.8—2.3 km for the recruitment envelope make it large? Small? Requilme provides more context to this measurement and what it implies for giant clam conservation: <br><br>“Actually for this species, it’s still small. [This] distance is [characteristic of] lower scale dispersal mechanism for a giant clam. [...] For this study alone, iyon ‘yung pino-point out namin na ‘yung individuals or population within this area, ito lang ‘yung recruitment envelope niya na pwede. There can be exemptions for other T. gigas in other sites and for other species as well, especially due to varying ocean current patterns. One of the cues na pwedeng mag-influence sa longer dispersal nila or higher recruitment envelope is ‘yung presence ng aggregates from neighboring reefs across different regions.” (“For this study alone, this is what we’re pointing out: that for the individuals or population within this area, the recruitment envelope is limited to this scale. [...] One of the cues that can influence longer dispersal or higher recruitment envelope is the presence of aggregates from neighboring reefs across different regions.”)<br><br>The research found good results, which Requilme attributed to the work of those before him. Locating T. gigas recruits implies that the population is starting to recover from being formerly extinct, and that the restocking efforts of the predecessors of Requilme and his team have been successful.  <br><br>“Naging successful ‘yung stocking efforts ng predecessors namin ー sila Dr. [Edgardo] Gomez na nag-start mag-culture at mag-breed ng giant clams [from the] early 1980s up to now. These recent years  pa lang nagpapakita ng positive results sa efforts nila. Doon namin mas na-appreciate ‘yung data na lumalabas.” (“The stocking efforts of our predecessors got successful ー Dr. [Edgardo] Gomez and others started to culture and breed giant clams [from the] early 1980s up to now. The positive results of their efforts have just begun to show these past recent years. That helped us appreciate the data that we were getting.”) <br><br> Requilme shares that, following this project, another giant clam survey is currently in the works. A national survey of giant clams and their recruits started in 2018, and the team has already received positive results from different restocking sites. “Hindi pa namin pwedeng ipakita yun kasi magclo-close pa lang ‘yung project with DOST. Currently, ito ‘yung project na wino-work namin.” (“We can’t disclose the results yet, since the project is just about to close with DOST. Currently, this is what we’re working on.”) <br><br> Requilme concludes the publication by highlighting the partnership between the CCMPC and the local fishers. Enlisting the help of fisherfolk ensures constant and efficient monitoring of the giant clam recruitment process, as well as paves the way for sustainable conservation measures. With their sizable contributions to the study as citizen scientists, it is also evident that they can play a major role in pushing other areas of research forward. <br><br>"Iyong commitment ng isang giant clam steward, like yung fishermen, kasama na yung managing non-governmental organization (NGO) — it implies na yung strong commitment talaga nila with this monitoring and yung influence nila with the local community is very strong and positive," Requilme says. "'Yung fishermen nila within that community is sila na yung nag-iinitiate na ibabalik yung giant clams. Ganun din yung advantage bakit namin na-pull yung ganitong data. Kasi 'yung main collaborator talaga namin is yung CCMPC." (“The commitment of a giant clam steward, like the fishermen, along with the NGO — it implies that their strong commitment in this monitoring and their influence within the local community are very strong and positive. The fishermen themselves were the ones who initiated to bring back the clams. That posed an advantage in pulling that sort of data, since our main collaborator is the CCMPC.”)</p>
       <p class="atlas-light location-content" style="font-size: 22px;" *ngIf="giantclamBool">The outlook for citizen science in the Philippines</p>
       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool">The CCMPC started out as a group of fisherfolk who were trained to manage and look after the giant clams and other inhabitants of the reefs, like corals, seagrasses, and nearby mangroves. The group became an NGO as it collaborated with different scientific institutions, including the Silliman University Angelo King Center for Research and Environmental Management in Dumaguete and Xavier University - Ateneo de Cagayan in Cagayan de Oro. By designing and proposing conservation projects, the CCMPC receives funding from the local government unit (LGU) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). <br><br>The fishers themselves benefit directly from the monitoring and conservation efforts. Aside from being a giant clam refuge and nursery, the CCMPC MPA is an ecotourism spot that generates a considerable amount of revenue for the fishers. Moreover, keeping the clams and the reefs healthy also ensures more catch.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool"> While the CCMPC is aided by several stakeholders, Requilme expressed concern over the lack of consistency when it comes to support. For one, a new LGU would mean new administration priorities, shifting focus from marine or environmental conservation to other concerns. Further, once a partner institution’s project funding ceases, the research that they conduct in the area is severely limited or even hindered. 
       <br><br>There are several factors that could slow down the advancement of conservation efforts but advocating for citizen science can strengthen the call for support for NGOs like the CCMPC. Although support, acknowledgment, and incentivization can drive the citizen science movement to greater heights, we need to publicize it first.<br><br>Jordan McRae, the engineer behind the crowdsourced ocean monitoring tech OCTOtalk, outlines in his TEDx talk5 the following elements needed for citizen science and scientific discovery to become a common or popular practice:<br><br> • The scope of the problem must be large enough for it to appear “impossible” unless everyone is involved. <br><br> •  Anyone feels welcome to participate. <br><br> • The process should be incentivized to inspire continuing participation. Incentives may include gamification or recognition. <br><br> • The collected data must constantly be validated externally by the scientific community, encouraging engagement between citizen and professional scientists. In the case of giant clam stewardship, Requilme believes that information and education campaigns are the best way to influence fishers to become skilled citizen scientists. But he also emphasizes that acknowledging the participation of the fishers, aside from the already-existing incentives promoted by the CCMPC, motivates other fishers to join the cause as well.<br><br>As a maritime country, the Philippines has a wealth of marine resources. Yet fishers do not receive enough compensation for their work, suffering from the impacts of climate change, marine degradation, and illegal overfishing by foreign entities. Through citizen science, they are empowered to mitigate these losses and contribute to marine conservation while creating new sources of income. <br><br> In a conversation with Mary Jane Cordero, a CCMPC volunteer who works on the information education campaign, we learn that the success of the giant clam conservation movement is derived from collaboration: <br><br> “Sa willingness ng mga tao to sacrifice, and then [sa commitment] nila sa mga project. ‘Yung challenge sa pagsisimula lang talaga is ‘yung knowledge dapat. Mahirap siya, especially if you do a project. If less ‘yung knowledge mo, and if you don’t have those people to guide you — ‘yung parang kayo-kayo lang ‘yung gagawa... We need the help of the people, particularly those who know a lot in that field din talaga.” (“In the willingness of people to sacrifice, and in their commitment toward the projects. The challenge in setting up the movement is in the knowledge. It’s difficult, especially if you do a project. If you don’t have enough knowledge, and if you don’t have those people to guide you — like when you’re doing things by yourselves... We need the help of the people, particularly those who know a lot in the field.” </p>
