      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool">In the Earth's oceans, various life forms experience dwindling populations, leading to decreased marine biodiversity. Scientists worldwide persist in improving current conservation practices as our situation demands for more radical solutions to the biodiversity problem that arises from exploitation, pollution, and climate change. </p>
      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool">One key component of marine conservation research is the monitoring of indicators related to biodiversity and ecosystem health, like changes in the physical properties of ocean water or the abundance of a certain organism.<sup>1</sup> Through monitoring activities, researchers generate sizeable databases of information — such extensive undertakings can be overwhelming and beyond the scope of available manpower. A viable solution is to employ citizen science, which can be loosely defined as the participation of volunteers in the collection (and, occasionally, analysis) of scientific data.<sup>2,3</sup> <br><br>Jeremiah Requilme, a UP MSI graduate student and research associate of the <a href="http://www.msi.upd.edu.ph/Research/laboratories/coral-reef-ecology-laboratory" style="color: #384e8a"> Coral Reef Ecology Laboratory </a>(CoRE, headed by Dr. Patrick Cabaitan), and colleagues published in 2020 the article, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S096456912030421X" target="_blank" style="color: #384e8a">"Using citizen science and survey data to determine the recruitment envelope of the endangered giant clam species, <em>Tridacna gigas</em> (Cardiidae: Tridacninae)<sup>4</sup>,"</a> which explores the fruitful outcomes of involving people outside the STEM profession in the data gathering process. In 2017, Requilme and the team set out to a marine protected area (MPA) in Cantaan, Guinsiliban, Camiguin Island to perform a field survey on the number and sizes of <em>T. gigas</em> recruits in the area. <br><br> The article reports 26 <em>T. gigas</em> recruits found 0.2—2.3 km from the clam restocking site, with the field survey returning a count of three recruits. This value is far from the accumulated number of T. gigas recruit sightings reported by the fisherfolk, which totals 23 recruits over a two-year monitoring period. Fishers assist the Cantaan Centennial Multi-purpose Cooperative (CCMPC) in keeping record of the clams. This difference in tally emphasizes the need for citizen science in large-scale and long-term monitoring efforts. <br><br> </p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" style="font-size: 22px;" *ngIf="giantclamBool">Luck-driven survival</p>
       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool">Once in a while, when temporal and environmental conditions are optimal, the hermaphroditic <em>T. gigas</em> clams simultaneously release eggs and sperm (reproductive cells or “gametes”) into the water column through a process called spawning. The gametes released by an individual would trigger spawning of neighbouring giant clams in a reef and thereafter, fertilization. Successful fertilization happens when gametes are fertilized by nearby giant clams. <br> <br> When fertilized gametes reach the planktonic larval stage, they stay afloat for eight to nine days in the water column, where they are at the mercy of the ocean currents. During this period, they search for suitable habitats or substrates. By the time giant clam larvae have selected and settled onto substrates, they are regarded as "recruits". <br><br> Chance plays a huge role in the propagation of giant clams, but there is another factor that gravely limits their growth: overharvesting. Years of poaching and predation have caused the numbers of <em>T. gigas</em> to decrease to the point of near-extinction. Native to the Indo-Pacific region, these giant clams are critical members of reef ecosystems, acting as food, shelter to fish, and reef builders. </p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool">The drastic decrease in giant clam population in the 1980s pushed marine scientists to initiate local conservation efforts. Apart from restocking and reintroducing giant clams in different sites around the Philippines, they monitored the giant clam populations. Not only that — they began to track the locations of recruits as well, a procedure that provides insight on the geographical scope, or “envelope,” of the recruitment process. Determining the recruitment envelope can help scientists come up with better conservation measures; that is, to identify possible factors or parameters to modify or control in order to circumvent the environmental restrictions of the natural recruitment process. However, tracing the locations of recruits is a "logistical nightmare," Requilme says. "Hindi mo madali ma-trace kung saan sila pupunta." (You can't easily trace where they would go.") <br><br> Scientists locate recruits through field surveys. In this study, Requilme and colleagues set up six survey sites having a 1,000 m<sup>2</sup> total area coverage. The field survey was conducted in January and April 2017, and the team was able to record the coordinates and sizes of three recruits. </p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" style="font-size: 22px;" *ngIf="giantclamBool">Fishers as citizen scientists</p>
       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool">The locals in Cantaan, a coastal barangay in Camiguin Island, know how integral giant clams are to the health of the ocean. In 1999, the CCMPC established a 3000 m<sup>2</sup> MPA that could serve as a sanctuary for giant clams. When recruits emerged in 2008, the CCMPC encouraged fisherfolk to report sightings while on their fishing routes. Many recruits were lost to poaching and predation, so the CCMPC began transferring them to a nursery in 2015.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool"> The fishers reported 23 sightings of giant clam recruits from 2015 to 2017. Compared to the result of the field survey, this number is almost eight times larger. We asked Requilme's insight on this disparity, to which he responded: <br><br>"Fishers, in contrast to researchers... Every day silang lumalabas para mangisda. More time sila sa reefs at livelihood nila 'to. They could have more opportunities [to record recruit sightings]. I can assume na most of these are accidental encounters lang. They’re familiar with the collaborating agency at doon na nila binibigay. Iyon 'yung main factor bakit ang laki ng discrepancy namin." ("They go out daily to fish. They have more time in the reefs and this is their livelihood. [...] I can assume that most of these are only accidental encounters. They're familiar with the collaborating agency and that is where they submit their findings. That's the main factor explaining why the discrepancy is so large.")<br><br>The participation of fisherfolk in the monitoring of clam recruits proved crucial to the conduct of the study. Their contributions, which include data on the recruits' locations and sizes, helped the researchers to estimate the recruitment envelope of <em>T. gigas</em> to be 800 m to 2.3 km.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" style="font-size: 22px;" *ngIf="giantclamBool">Advocating for citizen science</p>
       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool">Does the determined range of 0.8—2.3 km for the recruitment envelope make it large? Small? Requilme provides more context to this measurement and what it implies for giant clam conservation: <br><br>“Actually for this species, it’s still small. [This] distance is [characteristic of] lower scale dispersal mechanism for a giant clam. [...] For this study alone, iyon ‘yung pino-point out namin na ‘yung individuals or population within this area, ito lang ‘yung recruitment envelope niya na pwede. There can be exemptions for other <em>T. gigas</em> in other sites and for other species as well, especially due to varying ocean current patterns. One of the cues na pwedeng mag-influence sa longer dispersal nila or higher recruitment envelope is ‘yung presence ng aggregates from neighboring reefs across different regions.” (“For this study alone, this is what we’re pointing out: that for the individuals or population within this area, the recruitment envelope is limited to this scale. [...] One of the cues that can influence longer dispersal or higher recruitment envelope is the presence of aggregates from neighboring reefs across different regions.”)<br><br>The research found good results, which Requilme attributed to the work of those before him. Locating <em>T. gigas</em> recruits implies that the population is starting to recover from being formerly extinct, and that the restocking efforts of the predecessors of Requilme and his team have been successful.  <br><br>“Naging successful ‘yung stocking efforts ng predecessors namin ー sila Dr. [Edgardo] Gomez na nag-start mag-culture at mag-breed ng giant clams [from the] early 1980s up to now. These recent years  pa lang nagpapakita ng positive results sa efforts nila. Doon namin mas na-appreciate ‘yung data na lumalabas.” (“The stocking efforts of our predecessors got successful ー Dr. [Edgardo] Gomez and others started to culture and breed giant clams [from the] early 1980s up to now. The positive results of their efforts have just begun to show these past recent years. That helped us appreciate the data that we were getting.”) <br><br> Requilme shares that, following this project, another giant clam survey is currently in the works. A national survey of giant clams and their recruits started in 2018, and the team has already received positive results from different restocking sites. “Hindi pa namin pwedeng ipakita yun kasi magclo-close pa lang ‘yung project with DOST. Currently, ito ‘yung project na wino-work namin.” (“We can’t disclose the results yet, since the project is just about to close with DOST. Currently, this is what we’re working on.”) <br><br> Requilme concludes the publication by highlighting the partnership between the CCMPC and the local fishers. Enlisting the help of fisherfolk ensures constant and efficient monitoring of the giant clam recruitment process, as well as paves the way for sustainable conservation measures. With their sizable contributions to the study as citizen scientists, it is also evident that they can play a major role in pushing other areas of research forward.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool">Iyong commitment ng isang giant clam steward, like yung fishermen, kasama na yung managing non-governmental organization (NGO) — it implies na yung strong commitment talaga nila with this monitoring and yung influence nila with the local community is very strong and positive," Requilme says. "'Yung fishermen nila within that community is sila na yung nag-iinitiate na ibabalik yung giant clams. Ganun din yung advantage bakit namin na-pull yung ganitong data. Kasi 'yung main collaborator talaga namin is yung CCMPC." (“The commitment of a giant clam steward, like the fishermen, along with the NGO — it implies that their strong commitment in this monitoring and their influence within the local community are very strong and positive.

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" style="font-size: 22px;" *ngIf="giantclamBool">The outlook for citizen science in the Philippines</p>
       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool">The CCMPC started out as a group of fisherfolk who were trained to manage and look after the giant clams and other inhabitants of the reefs, like corals, seagrasses, and nearby mangroves. The group became an NGO as it collaborated with different scientific institutions, including the Silliman University Angelo King Center for Research and Environmental Management in Dumaguete and Xavier University - Ateneo de Cagayan in Cagayan de Oro. By designing and proposing conservation projects, the CCMPC receives funding from the local government unit (LGU) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). <br><br>The fishers themselves benefit directly from the monitoring and conservation efforts. Aside from being a giant clam refuge and nursery, the CCMPC MPA is an ecotourism spot that generates a considerable amount of revenue for the fishers. Moreover, keeping the clams and the reefs healthy also ensures more catch.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool"> While the CCMPC is aided by several stakeholders, Requilme expressed concern over the lack of consistency when it comes to support. For one, a new LGU would mean new administration priorities, shifting focus from marine or environmental conservation to other concerns. Further, once a partner institution’s project funding ceases, the research that they conduct in the area is severely limited or even hindered.
       <br><br>There are several factors that could slow down the advancement of conservation efforts but advocating for citizen science can strengthen the call for support for NGOs like the CCMPC. Although support, acknowledgment, and incentivization can drive the citizen science movement to greater heights, we need to publicize it first.<br><br>Jordan McRae, the engineer behind the crowdsourced ocean monitoring tech OCTOtalk, outlines in his TEDx talk<sup>5</sup> the following elements needed for citizen science and scientific discovery to become a common or popular practice:</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" style="margin-left: 30px;" *ngIf="giantclamBool"> • The scope of the problem must be large enough for it to appear “impossible” unless everyone is involved.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" style="margin-left: 30px;" *ngIf="giantclamBool">•  Anyone feels welcome to participate.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" style="margin-left: 30px;" *ngIf="giantclamBool">• The process should be incentivized to inspire continuing participation. Incentives may include gamification or recognition. </p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" style="margin-left: 30px;" *ngIf="giantclamBool">• The collected data must constantly be validated externally by the scientific community, encouraging engagement between citizen and professional scientists.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="giantclamBool">In the case of giant clam stewardship, Requilme believes that information and education campaigns are the best way to influence fishers to become skilled citizen scientists. But he also emphasizes that acknowledging the participation of the fishers, aside from the already-existing incentives promoted by the CCMPC, motivates other fishers to join the cause as well.<br><br>As a maritime country, the Philippines has a wealth of marine resources. Yet fishers do not receive enough compensation for their work, suffering from the impacts of climate change, marine degradation, and illegal overfishing by foreign entities. Through citizen science, they are empowered to mitigate these losses and contribute to marine conservation while creating new sources of income. <br><br> In a conversation with Mary Jane Cordero, a CCMPC volunteer who works on the information education campaign, we learn that the success of the giant clam conservation movement is derived from collaboration: <br><br> “Sa willingness ng mga tao to sacrifice, and then [sa commitment] nila sa mga project. ‘Yung challenge sa pagsisimula lang talaga is ‘yung knowledge dapat. Mahirap siya, especially if you do a project. If less ‘yung knowledge mo, and if you don’t have those people to guide you — ‘yung parang kayo-kayo lang ‘yung gagawa... We need the help of the people, particularly those who know a lot in that field din talaga.” (“In the willingness of people to sacrifice, and in their commitment toward the projects. The challenge in setting up the movement is in the knowledge. It’s difficult, especially if you do a project. If you don’t have enough knowledge, and if you don’t have those people to guide you — like when you’re doing things by yourselves... We need the help of the people, particularly those who know a lot in the field.”</p>

      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">Despite occupying only 0.1% (285,000 km<sup>2</sup>)of the ocean floor, corals are integral in marine biodiversity and geology, fisheries, and natural products chemistry. They are their own ecosystems, housing thousands, maybe even millions, of organisms. The majority of the corals worldwide thrive in the warm waters of the tropics and are found in regions like the Pacific Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Persian Gulf. </p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">While preventative measures are still the primary methods of ensuring the health and safety of corals and coral reefs, more knowledge on coral restoration can potentially complement these practices. Corals lead productive lives in symbiosis with many organisms, and their degradation or disappearance can have dangerous effects on the state of the oceans. According to scientists and conservationists, environmental cues and the corresponding physiological processes, like metabolism and reproduction, can be monitored to ensure that corals live and survive under optimal conditions.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">In a paper by Charlon Ligson and Dr. Patrick Cabaitan of the <a href="https://www.msi.upd.edu.ph/Research/laboratories/coral-reef-ecology-laboratory"  target="_blank"  style="color: #384e8a;">Coral Reef Ecology (CoRE)</a> Laboratory, the survival rates of coral outplants four years post-outplantation were monitored and associated with their characteristics. <em><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rec.13363" target="_blank" style="color: #384e8a;">“Survival and sexual maturity of sexually propagated Acropora verweyi corals 4 years after outplantation,” </a></em> <sup>1</sup> published in 2021, explores coral survivorship by comparing the survival rates of 240 <em>A. verweyi</em> corals, while checking the effect of two parameters: the size of the coral outplant and the location of the outplantation site.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" *ngIf="charlonBool">Threatened homes</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">A member of the phylum Cnidaria alongside nematocyst-bearing invertebrates like jellyfish and sea anemones, corals are clusters of tiny organisms called coral polyps. There can be as many as a million polyps in a single coral and, within each polyp, a million microalgae per cm<sup>2</sup> that perform photosynthesis. One can say that corals are aggregates of little organisms that function together.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">Small creatures, in large numbers, can accomplish great feats in construction. Corals are <em>foundation species</em> — they are capable of forming habitats due to the sheer number of corals in the marine benthos and their mutualistic interactions with other species in the ecosystem.<sup>2</sup> Soft and hard corals grow into various morphologies, building reefs with intricate architectures in the process. Many species of fish and invertebrates take advantage of their structural features to form strategies for survival.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">Aside from building reefs, corals also form a breakwater, a type of structural protection from waves and cyclones. They can be sources of natural products or chemical compounds that are screened for potential use in medicine and pharmaceutics. In the Philippines, they are crucial to coastal communities, not only for food security but also by aiding the livelihoods of the people living there.<sup>3</sup></p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">Corals are among the organisms that directly bear the brunt of global warming. The rise in ocean temperatures induces bleaching, whereby the algae that provide color to the corals are expelled due to external stresses. Since algae are the main food source of corals, bleaching forces the corals into a state of starvation. Anthropogenic activities like exploitation of fisheries and pollution also threaten and degrade coral reefs.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" *ngIf="charlonBool">Science as a tool to rehabilitate reefs</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">How do we make sure that reef inhabitants retain their homes?</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">“Coral restoration is a complex puzzle that involves figuring the right pieces to match perfectly,” Ligson says. “These puzzle pieces include the site, corals, other marine organisms, people, money, governance, etc. But a small puzzle piece that our paper explored pertains to time. It takes a long time to grow baby coral to sizes with a better chance of survival when outplanted on the reef.”</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">Restoration methods can be active or passive: passive restoration involves the control or removal of disturbances to the reef system, while active restoration is initiated by human intervention. Coral outplantation is an example of active restoration, along with substrate stabilization, the addition of artificial reefs, coral outplantation, coral sexual propagation, and larval enhancement.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">The 240 coral outplants monitored in this study were transferred in 2015 from the nursery to two sites in Cabungan and Caniogan, Anda, Pangasinan, respectively. Outplantation typically begins with identifying gravid or “pregnant” colonies. Researchers keep an eye out for spawning activity during the full moon phases of March to July and, at the appropriate time, collect coral fragments and check them for the presence of colored eggs. This characteristic qualifies coral colonies as “gravid,” a technical term meaning “pregnant.”</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">Once these corals are transferred to the lab, researchers wait for the corals to spawn at nighttime, and the eggs and sperm are mixed to promote fertilization. The embryos develop into larvae soon after, then they are given transportable substrates to settle upon. The juveniles are maintained in nurseries for several months before they are outplanted on degraded reefs.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">Ligson wondered: how effective can outplantation efforts be years after they were conducted? This question also motivated him to jumpstart his study. He shares:</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">“I was working on my thesis experiment, but my earlier attempts failed. So, out of desperation, I went on the field to look for the last coral species that might spawn. And then, when we were looking for a potential species, we just remembered that we were diving in our previous outplantation site. So, we went to our former study site and searched for our coral outplants. And to our surprise, they were still there after four years! To top it all, a lot of them were gravid.”</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content2" *ngIf="charlonBool">Coral reef restoration in the Philippines</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">Ligson conducted his study in the municipality of Anda, Pangasinan, northwestern Philippines, where the Caniogan and Cabungan reefs of the Bolinao-Anda reef complex are located. When asked if there were existing coral restoration practices in the area, he responded, “To my knowledge, the communities in these areas have no current restoration efforts in place. But the communities are aware of marine and fish sanctuaries and the protected areas.”</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">As an aspiring marine biologist who specializes in coral sexual propagation for coral restoration, Ligson has seven years of practice in the field under his belt. He contemplates the need for a comprehensive study on the effectiveness of coral restoration efforts in the Philippines but supposes that it may be highly variable, depending on the coral species, sites, and methods.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">One way to check the success of restoration practices is to study the characteristics of sexually mature coral outplants (corals that have been outplanted or transferred to an external site), and monitor them over a period of time. Simultaneously, the effect of key factors like the ages and sizes of the outplants during outplantation can be correlated with these characteristics.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" *ngIf="charlonBool">Connecting outplant characteristics to survival</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">Ligson shares that this study augments the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-013-1114-1" target="_blank"  style="color: #384e8a;">previous research of Dr. ‪Maria Vanessa Baria-Rodriguez and her co-authors</a>, where they did similar propagation work using a different species. “After growing their corals, [Dr. Baria-Rodriguez’ group] outplanted them at different periods, namely, at 7, 14, and 19 months of rearing. One insight from their study is that colonies reared for many months in the nursery may have an advantage in survival.”</p>

      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">However, long periods of rearing do not always ensure this advantage, as the corals can still be subject to bad conditions like predation or temperature spikes in the nursery.</p>

       </div> 

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">“I just got curious if it is feasible to outplant these corals as early as four months,” he says. “In addition to the age aspect, we also have the size and site aspects. Though our corals are very young, we compared small and large coral babies of the same age. We outplanted them on two sites to check if there will be some site-specific differences.”</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">When Ligson surveyed the corals in 2019, four years after outplantation, he found that only 43 in total survived — 24 in Caniogan and 19 in Cabungan. A higher survival rate for the large coral outplants in Caniogan was observed, possibly due to the turbidity of the water in the area. Meanwhile, no difference in survivorship was noted between small and large coral outplants in Cabungan. Despite differences in survivorship in the two size classes, Ligson observed that all coral outplants grew to a similar size after four years regardless of their initial size. It could be that it is only during the first year post-outplantation that the initial sizes of the outplant would pose an advantage. Once the outplants survive the year, the initial size may not matter anymore.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">Of the 43 remaining corals, 35 were gravid. This is an important finding because having a high percentage of gravid corals gives us confidence that outplants can survive up to sexual maturity and become crucial contributors to the survival of the species and, consequently, to the rebuilding of degraded coral communities.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content2" *ngIf="charlonBool">Using the knowledge to develop restoration strategies</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">Coral restoration is still being studied thoroughly and conducted at a small scale, so its caveats must be determined first. Still, Ligson emphasizes that this type of information should not be kept hidden in lab reports, that “it is imperative to share this valuable information not only with fellow researchers but to the community.”</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="charlonBool">“It is timely to talk about coral restoration, given that the United Nations declared 2021-2030 as the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. It is a big challenge for our government, the academe, the NGOs, and all citizens to incorporate restoration knowledge into practice. So let's continue working together. As I have mentioned, coral restoration is a complex puzzle. We researchers may hold a few puzzle pieces, but we need the whole community to complete these pieces.”</p>
