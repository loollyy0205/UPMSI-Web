      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="myArr[0].enarfleetbool"><em>Established as a response to limited ocean research capacity, the National Academic Research Fleet (NARFleet) program aims to provide better access to ocean research for the academe, private institutions, and the Philippine government. To achieve this, participating research groups will address problems such as reef protection and productivity, mapping the pelagic zone, and maximizing the use of bio resources. The University of the Philippines Visayas (UPV), Bicol University, and Mindanao State University - Iligan Institute of Technology (MSU-IIT) join the UP Marine Science Institute as collaborators and vessel hosts. </em></p>
     

      <hr *ngIf="myArr[0].enarfleetbool">

      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="myArr[0].enarfleetbool">In light of new and emerging issues such as climate change, plastics pollution, and the growing tensions in our national waters, ocean research has become a priority. Locally, the capacity to perform scientific activities in coastal and open water regions remains limited and is in dire need of upgrading and expansion. For this, the UP Marine Science Institute (MSI) has begun the establishment of the NARFleet, a group of vessels dedicated to marine science research (MSR), with the support of the National Security Council (NSC).</p>
      
      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="myArr[0].enarfleetbool">Headed by Dr. Deo Florence Onda, the project component NARFleet (Project 2) is implemented under the program “Upgrading Capacity, Infrastructure, and Assets for Marine Scientific Research in the Philippines (Upgrade CIA)” led by the UP MSI Director, Dr. Laura T. David. The project aims to distribute the assets throughout the country and to empower state universities and colleges (SUCs) and other higher educational institutions (HEIs) outside Metro Manila to do ocean studies. Three collaborating SUCs were identified to be Bicol University (northeast Philippines), UP Visayas (Eastern Philippines/Visayan Seas), and the Mindanao State University – Iligan Institute of Technology (Sulu Sea/Southern Seas). </p>

      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="myArr[0].enarfleetbool">The NARFleet’s long-term sustainability plan spans 16 years and is divided into three phases. Logistics planning and procurement of assets are currently underway as part of the first phase and capacity building for partner host universities (2019 to 2022). The second phase (2023 to 2028) focuses on local MSRs and expanding the scope of research activities, as well as training more researchers and institutions to conduct ocean-based studies. Finally, the last phase (2029 to 2035) will help expand the MSR efforts to include international collaborators.</p>

      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="myArr[0].enarfleetbool">There are seven vessels in the current list of assets, including the existing <em>MY Panata</em> of UP MSI and four other vessels that are still being procured. <em>MY Panata</em>, one of the active vessels funded by the UP System, has already accomplished several missions in the West Philippine Sea (2019 & 2021), the Visayan Seas (2019), and the Tubbataha Reefs and Sulu Sea (2019 & 2021) since its maiden voyage in 2019. It has significantly increased UP MSI’s capacity in performing fieldwork in the different maritime regions of the country. Its accomplishments also emphasize the need for dedicated floating assets for research.</p>


      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="myArr[0].enarfleetbool">Currently, the NARFleet coordination and management group is facilitating the procurement of the four new vessels, with a total budget of PhP 110 million granted by the Philippine Government. These include a used sail or power catamaran which will be deployed in inner seas, including the Verde Island Passage, for oceanographic work, habitat monitoring, and marine technology testing. One of the  research vessels will also be stationed in the Visayas waters and the Bohol Sea, while another one will be dedicated to the exploration of the Mindanao waters, like the Sulu Sea and Sulawesi. Lastly, the third research vessel will be based in the Pacific Seaboard and the West Philippine Sea for diving and oceanographic work. The bidding process for the used sail or power catamaran has been completed and the awarding is being finalized, while the research vessels are still undergoing bidding.</p>

      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="myArr[0].enarfleetbool">Two other anticipated developments are the NARFleet website launch and the participation of <em>MY Panata</em> in the upcoming cruise in the Kalayaan Island Group (KIG). The cruise, which will run from late September to the majority of October, focuses on the refurbishment of the Pagasa Island Research Station (PIRS), setting up of AIS and Ocean Monitoring System, and survey of reef fish and fisheries in the area and pollution, such as plastics. Meanwhile, the website is scheduled to be released within the year.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="myArr[0].enarfleetbool">With these vessels that make up a whole fleet dedicated to research and the support of NSC, other government agencies, and partner universities/institutions, the UP MSI hopes to scale up Philippine MSRs and ocean research programs, inspiring more young scientists to participate in research addressing contemporary climate and national security issues.</p>

      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">While world leaders from developed countries are slowly enacting environmental policies to reach their climate targets and transition into a fully carbon-neutral society to combat climate change, small island nations everywhere are proving to be more adept.</p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">In the Philippines, there’s an island that is set out to make an example for many others.</p>

         <p class="atlas-bold location-content" style="font-size: 20px;" *ngIf="pirsBool"><br><em>Where it all begins</em></p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">The Pagasa Island Research Station (PIRS) in Pagasa Island was first established in 1997 with support from the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) - Philippine Council for Aquatic and Marine Research and Development (PCAMRD)  and in cooperation with the Western Command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (WESCOM).</p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">According to Dr. Rene Abesamis, who was then a research assistant and part of the original team that established the research center PIRS oon Pag-asa island, the structure was prefabricated and initially meant for Tubbataha Reef. Through arrangements made with the Department of National Defense (DND), it was transferred to its current location. </p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">However, due to a lack of sustainable funding and accessibility to the area, the utilization of the research station was not maximized and was limited only for the use of  divers from the Philippine Navy. They later called it Frogman’s Quarters because of the animal’s webbed feet that resembled a diver’s fins. </p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">The structure had not been occupied for some time after its inauguration in 2000, leaving the dome-shaped building in a damaged state and thus is in need of repairs for it to be fully functional again. Now, it is being reclaimed as the marine science research station it once was. </p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">One of the components of the University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute’s (UP MSI) Upgrading Capability, Infrastructure and Assets (UPGRADE CIA) program is to conduct ocular inspection and assessment to identify what needs to be done for the restoration of PIRS.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">This project is also known as the Initial Repair and Refurbishment of the Pagasa station or iRARE Pagasa</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">“Mula noong na-inaugurate siya, hindi na siya nabalikan ng MSI. Part of the reason was that there was a sudden shift in the priorities for funding by the national government. Alam natin na hindi madaling makapunta doon, but the interest of putting up a laboratory there remains the same,” shares iRARE Project Leader Dr. Fernando Siringan, who is a professor at UP MSI and a NAST academician.</p>


        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">From the latest assessment during the 2021 WPS expeditions, PIRS was found to be in a sorry state with a significant number of cracks on its walls, visible signs of water leaks, and corroded electrical lines.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">The iRARE team with the Physical Oceanography group began the refurbishment efforts during the WPS Summer 2021 expeditions by installing a 1 kW solar panel system to power up the station. An Automatic Identification System (AIS) for tracking the movement of ships in the area was also installed.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">The repairs and installation of new features, including an Automatic Identification System (AIS) for tracking the movement of ships in the area are scheduled to be conducted in October 2021</p>

         <p class="atlas-bold location-content" style="font-size: 20px;" *ngIf="pirsBool"><br><em>Marine Science Research as the core of future plans</em></p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">Sea level changes have been affecting small islands, including the coral reefs that surround them. The rate by which the sea level rises has varying effects on the marine environment: a slow rate allows the reef to keep pace through vertical accretion, while a fast rate can drown reefs.</p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">Sea level rise due to climate change compounded by long-term subsidence poses a huge threat to Pagasa Island and other similarly small and low lying landforms in the West Philippine Sea. Coastal erosion and salinization of limited groundwater resources are major concerns.</p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">This, along with other needs of the Philippines, make Marine Science Research (MSR) programs more relevant than ever as they can enable the protection of our lands and waters, especially those in the West Philippine Sea (WPS). </p>

          <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">As a maritime nation, the establishment of a marine science research center on the island is key in understanding the WPS’ marine resources and their sustainable utilization. Since the area is geographically isolated, many of its features are different from the mainland and neighboring islands, so there is much more to discover. According to Siringan, the establishment and full utilization of PIRS affirms the Philippine sovereignty in Pagasa Island.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">The 2021 WPS expeditions are scheduled to resume in September, and Siringan’s team is prioritizing the completion of PIRS refurbishment tasks so that it will be available for use by next year.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">Aside from the repairs, the team has also been studying relative sea level changes around the island through bathymetry and side scan surveys, looking at geomorphic indicators of previous sea level stands using single beam systems. This will improve their understanding of the geological changes in the Kalayaan Island Group  and aid the local and national government in designing ways to address the expected mal-impacts of relative sea level rise. They will be moving forward with their study on the upcoming second leg of the expeditions.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">“If the sea would allow us then we will do a multibeam bathymetric survey. If we have time, we will also do some groundwater surveys using electrical resistivity. And then, we will go around the island and look at the state of the coastline and the materials of the beach. We will also estimate the island’s elevation by using the Emery (1961) method for beach profiling,” he says.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">Siringan also mentioned a proposed research program called Small Island Life Sustenance in the WPS (SmILeS WPS) to transform islands like Pagasa into regenerative islands that sustain life while also reassuring the integrity of the environment through sustainable means.</p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">“He ruminates by saying, “Bakit hindi natin gamitin ang Pagasa as a platform for the use of renewable energy? Gulay sa maliliit na isla—ano ang pwedeng maitanim? Pwede bang mag-alaga ng mga hayop? Gamitin ang dumi ng manok, kambing at baboy para [maging fertilizer]. Napakakaunti ng tubig tabang doon ngayon. Kailangan din maghanap ng paraan para masustain ang kalidad at availability ng tubig tabang doon.”</p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">Through research and development, renewable energy, farming, and groundwater protection are among many other possible future projects under SmILeS WPS,  The iRARE team is also considering application technology for the institute’s successful studies, such as seaweed culture, sea ranching of sea cucumbers, and integrated multitrophic aquaculture in the adjacent atoll lagoon. Partnership with the Pagasa community will be forged to enhance buy-in and adoption of research results. Results of research in PIRS can direct development in similar small islands.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">PIRS will be open to any Filipino researcher looking to work within the island or the WPS area. It will also be opened to foreign researchers in the near future. </p>
