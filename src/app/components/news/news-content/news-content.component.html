      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="myArr[0].enarfleetbool">In light of new and emerging issues such as climate change, plastics pollution, and the growing tensions in our national waters, ocean research has become a priority. Locally, the capacity to perform scientific activities in coastal and open water regions remains limited and is in dire need of upgrading and expansion. For this, the UP Marine Science Institute (MSI) has begun the establishment of the NARFleet, a group of vessels dedicated to marine science research (MSR), with the support of the National Security Council (NSC).</p>
      
      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="myArr[0].enarfleetbool">Headed by Dr. Deo Florence Onda, the project component NARFleet (Project 2) is implemented under the program “Upgrading Capacity, Infrastructure, and Assets for Marine Scientific Research in the Philippines (Upgrade CIA)” led by the UP MSI Director, Dr. Laura T. David. The project aims to distribute the assets throughout the country and to empower state universities and colleges (SUCs) and other higher educational institutions (HEIs) outside Metro Manila to do ocean studies. Three collaborating SUCs were identified to be Bicol University (northeast Philippines), UP Visayas (Eastern Philippines/Visayan Seas), and the Mindanao State University – Iligan Institute of Technology (Sulu Sea/Southern Seas). </p>

      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="myArr[0].enarfleetbool">The NARFleet’s long-term sustainability plan spans 16 years and is divided into three phases. Logistics planning and procurement of assets are currently underway as part of the first phase and capacity building for partner host universities (2019 to 2022). The second phase (2023 to 2028) focuses on local MSRs and expanding the scope of research activities, as well as training more researchers and institutions to conduct ocean-based studies. Finally, the last phase (2029 to 2035) will help expand the MSR efforts to include international collaborators.</p>

      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="myArr[0].enarfleetbool">There are seven vessels in the current list of assets, including the existing <em>MY Panata</em> of UP MSI and four other vessels that are still being procured. <em>MY Panata</em>, one of the active vessels funded by the UP System, has already accomplished several missions in the West Philippine Sea (2019 & 2021), the Visayan Seas (2019), and the Tubbataha Reefs and Sulu Sea (2019 & 2021) since its maiden voyage in 2019. It has significantly increased UP MSI’s capacity in performing fieldwork in the different maritime regions of the country. Its accomplishments also emphasize the need for dedicated floating assets for research.</p>


      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="myArr[0].enarfleetbool">Currently, the NARFleet coordination and management group is facilitating the procurement of the four new vessels, with a total budget of PhP 110 million granted by the Philippine Government. These include a used sail or power catamaran which will be deployed in inner seas, including the Verde Island Passage, for oceanographic work, habitat monitoring, and marine technology testing. One of the  research vessels will also be stationed in the Visayas waters and the Bohol Sea, while another one will be dedicated to the exploration of the Mindanao waters, like the Sulu Sea and Sulawesi. Lastly, the third research vessel will be based in the Pacific Seaboard and the West Philippine Sea for diving and oceanographic work. The bidding process for the used sail or power catamaran has been completed and the awarding is being finalized, while the research vessels are still undergoing bidding.</p>

      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="myArr[0].enarfleetbool">Two other anticipated developments are the NARFleet website launch and the participation of <em>MY Panata</em> in the upcoming cruise in the Kalayaan Island Group (KIG). The cruise, which will run from late September to the majority of October, focuses on the refurbishment of the Pagasa Island Research Station (PIRS), setting up of AIS and Ocean Monitoring System, and survey of reef fish and fisheries in the area and pollution, such as plastics. Meanwhile, the website is scheduled to be released within the year.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="myArr[0].enarfleetbool">With these vessels that make up a whole fleet dedicated to research and the support of NSC, other government agencies, and partner universities/institutions, the UP MSI hopes to scale up Philippine MSRs and ocean research programs, inspiring more young scientists to participate in research addressing contemporary climate and national security issues.</p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">In the Philippines, there’s an island that is set out to make an example for many others.</p>

         <p class="subtitle atlas-bold location-content3" style="font-size: 20px;" *ngIf="pirsBool"><br><em>Where it all begins</em></p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">The Pagasa Island Research Station (PIRS) in Pagasa Island was first established in 1997 with support from the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) - Philippine Council for Aquatic and Marine Research and Development (PCAMRD)  and in cooperation with the Western Command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (WESCOM).</p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">According to Dr. Rene Abesamis, who was then a research assistant and part of the original team that established the research center PIRS oon Pag-asa island, the structure was prefabricated and initially meant for Tubbataha Reef. Through arrangements made with the Department of National Defense (DND), it was transferred to its current location. </p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">However, due to a lack of sustainable funding and accessibility to the area, the utilization of the research station was not maximized and was limited only for the use of  divers from the Philippine Navy. They later called it Frogman’s Quarters because of the animal’s webbed feet that resembled a diver’s fins. </p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">The structure had not been occupied for some time after its inauguration in 2000, leaving the dome-shaped building in a damaged state and thus is in need of repairs for it to be fully functional again. Now, it is being reclaimed as the marine science research station it once was. </p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">One of the components of the University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute’s (UP MSI) Upgrading Capability, Infrastructure and Assets (UPGRADE CIA) program is to conduct ocular inspection and assessment to identify what needs to be done for the restoration of PIRS.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">This project is also known as the Initial Repair and Refurbishment of the Pagasa station or iRARE Pagasa</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">“Mula noong na-inaugurate siya, hindi na siya nabalikan ng MSI. Part of the reason was that there was a sudden shift in the priorities for funding by the national government. Alam natin na hindi madaling makapunta doon, but the interest of putting up a laboratory there remains the same,” shares iRARE Project Leader Dr. Fernando Siringan, who is a professor at UP MSI and a NAST academician.</p>


        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">From the latest assessment during the 2021 WPS expeditions, PIRS was found to be in a sorry state with a significant number of cracks on its walls, visible signs of water leaks, and corroded electrical lines.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">The iRARE team with the Physical Oceanography group began the refurbishment efforts during the WPS Summer 2021 expeditions by installing a 1 kW solar panel system to power up the station. An Automatic Identification System (AIS) for tracking the movement of ships in the area was also installed.</p>

         <p class="atlas-bold location-content3" style="font-size: 20px;" *ngIf="pirsBool"><br><em>Marine Science Research as the core of future plans</em></p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">Sea level changes have been affecting small islands, including the coral reefs that surround them. The rate by which the sea level rises has varying effects on the marine environment: a slow rate allows the reef to keep pace through vertical accretion, while a fast rate can drown reefs.</p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">Sea level rise due to climate change compounded by long-term subsidence poses a huge threat to Pagasa Island and other similarly small and low lying landforms in the West Philippine Sea. Coastal erosion and salinization of limited groundwater resources are major concerns.</p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">This, along with other needs of the Philippines, make Marine Science Research (MSR) programs more relevant than ever as they can enable the protection of our lands and waters, especially those in the West Philippine Sea (WPS). </p>

          <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">As a maritime nation, the establishment of a marine science research center on the island is key in understanding the WPS’ marine resources and their sustainable utilization. Since the area is geographically isolated, many of its features are different from the mainland and neighboring islands, so there is much more to discover. According to Siringan, the establishment and full utilization of PIRS affirms the Philippine sovereignty in Pagasa Island.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">The 2021 WPS expeditions are scheduled to resume in September, and Siringan’s team is prioritizing the completion of PIRS refurbishment tasks so that it will be available for use by next year.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">Aside from the repairs, the team has also been studying relative sea level changes around the island through bathymetry and side scan surveys, looking at geomorphic indicators of previous sea level stands using single beam systems. This will improve their understanding of the geological changes in the Kalayaan Island Group  and aid the local and national government in designing ways to address the expected mal-impacts of relative sea level rise. They will be moving forward with their study on the upcoming second leg of the expeditions.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">“If the sea would allow us then we will do a multibeam bathymetric survey. If we have time, we will also do some groundwater surveys using electrical resistivity. And then, we will go around the island and look at the state of the coastline and the materials of the beach. We will also estimate the island’s elevation by using the Emery (1961) method for beach profiling,” he says.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">Siringan also mentioned a proposed research program called Small Island Life Sustenance in the WPS (SmILeS WPS) to transform islands like Pagasa into regenerative islands that sustain life while also reassuring the integrity of the environment through sustainable means.</p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">“He ruminates by saying, “Bakit hindi natin gamitin ang Pagasa as a platform for the use of renewable energy? Gulay sa maliliit na isla—ano ang pwedeng maitanim? Pwede bang mag-alaga ng mga hayop? Gamitin ang dumi ng manok, kambing at baboy para [maging fertilizer]. Napakakaunti ng tubig tabang doon ngayon. Kailangan din maghanap ng paraan para masustain ang kalidad at availability ng tubig tabang doon.”</p>

Partnership with the Pagasa community will be forged to enhance buy-in and adoption of research results. Results of research in PIRS can direct development in similar small islands.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="pirsBool">PIRS will be open to any Filipino researcher looking to work within the island or the WPS area. It will also be opened to foreign researchers in the near future. </p>

       <p class="subtitle atlas-light location-content2" *ngIf="merfBool"><br>An Exchange of Knowledge</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" *ngIf="merfBool">Researchers and professors from UP MSI gave in-depth lectures and held exercises on water quality monitoring; aerial, surface, and underwater data gathering techniques for coastal and ocean resources; and the valuation process from an actual case of local coral damage.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" *ngIf="merfBool">Day 1 tackled phytoplankton, their importance as primary producers, and the threats they face from climate change and (micro)plastics pollution. Ms. Erika Grace Gernato, a researcher, discussed the methods involved in phytoplankton monitoring, such as the plankton net, microscopic imaging, and plankton identification. Her lecture was complemented by Ms. Norchel Gomez’s discussion on plastics monitoring and how it can help us address and mitigate pollution.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" *ngIf="merfBool">Water quality monitoring was the focus of Day 2. Marine chemist Dr. Charissa Ferrera shared her expertise on measuring different parameters related to water quality, including how to use the Conductivity Temperature and Pressure (CTD) system, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), and multiparameter sensor.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content2" *ngIf="merfBool">Not only was the workshop an opportunity to learn, but it also served to remind the participants of the importance of their work and cause. Dr. Deo Florence Onda, Deputy Director for Research (DDR) of UP MSI and Project Leader of the activity, opened the workshop with a presentation on the connectivity of the ecosystems in the Philippines, as well as the challenges its coastal and marine environment are experiencing.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" *ngIf="merfBool">Project coordinator and workshop moderator Ms. Miraflor Sanchez followed with a talk on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to set the motivation and rationale behind the workshop. Her talk included the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, which started this year and goes by the theme, “The Science We Need for the Ocean We Want.”</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content2" *ngIf="merfBool">On the last day, Atty. Jay Batongbacal gave a lecture on the history, significance, and current state of Philippine sovereignty in the WPS, rightfully concluding the week-long online workshop.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" *ngIf="merfBool">In the end, CG RADM Rolando Lizor N. Punzalan was called on to provide a response on behalf of the PCG. He talked about the tasks PCG has been carrying out in different parts of the country to protect its waters and the need for more collaboration among all stakeholders.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content2" *ngIf="merfBool">LTJG Gerald L. Cordero also took the time to thank all the organizers and members of the PCG, expressing appreciation for their active participation and interest to learn. "Kayo po yung andito from the first to last day. Kayo din po mismo ang nagtatanong ano ang mga kailangan gawin, ano yung mga software na makakabilis sa pagtrabaho at ano ang mga best way sa pagsasagawa nito. We're all excited that a part of our training will be physical at actual na gagawin," he says. </p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" *ngIf="merfBool">Dr. Onda also shared the future plans of the national government and UP MSI to further strengthen and upgrade our capacity to do  more marine scientific research activities (MSRs) in the country. He further stressed the importance of interagency cooperation and collaboration in carrying out such activities. “Hindi dito natatapos ang collaboration ng UPMSI, MERF, at PCG. At hindi rin po dito natatapos ang pagpapalawig natin ng karanasan ng ating mga tanod dagat,” he says.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content2" *ngIf="merfBool">He ended his message by saying that these workshops and the work being done are a continuation of a long-term partnership as co-protectors of the sea.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool" style="margin-top: -40px;">Experts discussed challenges and opportunities in the approval process and framework for marine scientific research (MSR) under international law as the Philippines continues to develop its MSR capability.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">Last March 2, 2022, the three-part “Track 1.5 Dialogue on Marine Scientific Research (MSR)” webinar series launched its first session. It was organized by the University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute (UP MSI), Foundation for the National Interest (FNI), the Marine Environment and Resources Foundation (MERF), and the United States Embassy in the Philippines. Dr. Charmaine Willoughby, international relations expert from the De La Salle University, and Dr. Gil Jacinto, retired professor from the UP MSI, served as moderators for the discussions.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">Government, Policy, and Law were the focus of the first panel of discussions, while Science and Research were of the second panel.</p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">U.S. Embassy in the Philippines' Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Ms. Heather Variava welcomed the audience with a message emphasizing the role MSR plays in reducing and preparing for the changes brought on by climate change and environmental damage. She discussed the value of international marine research to help people better understand the threats of biodiversity loss, coral damage, and water quality changes. She also mentioned that improved maritime domain awareness and robust protection of environmental crimes are critical to ensuring the survival of the Philippines’ marine ecosystem for future generations.</p>


       <p class="atlas-bold location-content3" style="font-size: 20px;" *ngIf="webBool"><br><em>MSR and the Law of the Sea</em></p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">MSR spans a range of scientific fields that study the oceans, their physical properties, and marine life. It has proven to be essential through the years with many contributions to human development, from food and medicine to energy. Through the study of the marine environment and the understanding of the many factors that affect it, its ecosystems are better protected with continued sustainable management. </p>

       

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">MSR was widely unregulated until the 1950s when the international community agreed to introduce a legal regime that requires coastal state consent for the conduct of research on the continental shelf. </p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">Today, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) serves as a legal framework that administers activities involving the world’s oceans. Since its enactment in 1982, one of the established freedoms of the convention is the freedom of scientific research on the high seas, making it a guiding principle in conducting MSR.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">In the first panel discussion on government policies and regulatory framework in conducting MSR, the featured speaker was Dr. James Kraska from the US Naval War College. Those who gave their reactions based on their experiences were Dr. Ahmad Almaududy from the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  Ms. Youna Lyons from the National University of Singapore - Center for International Law, and Mr. Christopher Madrigal, an independent consultant in the Philippines.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">To start, Dr. Kraska explained the general principles of MSR, what is and what is not MSR, its broad definitions, and the process of conducting it in the territorial seas of coastal states under the UNCLOS.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">He adds that there is no specific definition of what constitutes marine scientific research in the law of the sea convention aside from the standard that it must be conducted for peaceful purposes and not to be used for armed conflict or aggression. Dr. Kraska says that it must only be for the pursuit of more knowledge for all mankind. He then further interprets that MSR must be disseminated widely as an open source so that all states may benefit from it, especially because we all rightfully share the marine environment.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">Dr. Kraska also mentioned the different challenges that researchers are faced with, including the lack of consent from coastal states and the national security concern in the South China Sea (SCS) region due to countries that have been asserting ‘rights protection.’ Lastly, he pointed out opportunities for countries like the Philippines to maximize MSR by undergoing large multilateral research programs. Although programs like these can still pose disagreements among states, it can also be taken as a challenge to assert good diplomacy.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">One of the first reactors, Dr. Almaududy, proposed the importance of a unified MSR regulation between neighboring maritime nations such as the Philippines and Indonesia — one that implements legal frameworks. He also believes that benefit sharing in MSR must be observed under the international law of common heritage of mankind.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">According to Atty. Lyons, the country must assess the environmental impact of MSR, especially during multiple expeditions in the same area, which may continually exploit resources during research activities. She recommended that data acquired from MSR be shared with other states to advance research in the region.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">With his vast experience working with the national government on MSR policy, Mr. Madrigal expressed his views on the state of MSR in the Philippines. He said that garnering more support for MSR from policymakers can be difficult due to the focus of the national development discourse being land-centric instead of archipelagic. But he also stated that steps are being taken by the government to establish transparency in the application process with the institutionalization of the revised foreign MSR application guidelines. While there is still much work left to be done in terms of tracking, monitoring, and collating MSR information, Mr. Madrigal considers this to be a way for different stakeholders to collaborate.</p>


       <p class="atlas-bold location-content3" style="font-size: 20px;" *ngIf="webBool"><br><em>Strengthening MSRs in Philippine Waters</em></p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">The Philippines is in the process of upgrading its capacity for marine research by building its own National Academic Research Fleet (NARFleet) under the Upgrading Capacity, Infrastructure, and Assets for Marine Scientific Research in the Philippines (UPGRADE CIA). Among the program’s long-term proposals is to distribute these vessels and assets to state universities and colleges (SUCs) and higher educational institutions (HEIs), particularly those outside the capital, to study our waters. </p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">The second panel discussion, led by Dr. Alan Jamieson from the University of Western Australia, focused on scientific approaches and research practices in MSR. Mr. Romain Troublé from Tara Expeditions Foundation, Mr. Gregory O’Brien from the Office of Ocean and Polar Affairs of the US Department of State, and Dr. Mohd Uzair bin Rusli from the Institute of Oceanography and Environment - Universiti Malaysia Terengganu were the reactors.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">Dr. Jamieson gave a summary of his MSR experience in different exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of various countries. According to him, each country has a different process when conducting MSR, despite UNCLOS. He further mused that scientific work can be simple, productive, and fun just as much as it is complicated, bureaucratic, and even highly politicized, recounting various experiences where local scientists and governments demand either authorship or ownership of the research data.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">Before closing his presentation, he gave a few recommendations to researchers on how to navigate the system including, remembering that not all MSR is controversial, looking at different ways to make the system more efficient, and making sure that you’re working with the right people.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">He strongly advised concentrating on people—building strong relationships founded on trust, friendship, and networks instead of money, politics, and authorship.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">Mr. Troublé shared similar experiences, saying that he too has had trouble collaborating with coastal states, especially in terms of streamlining processes. He ended by saying that more data, tools, and technologies are needed to understand marine biodiversity, which is why regulation on MSR is important. </p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">As a Senior Oceans Policy Advisor who works in processing applications for MSR in the US and oversees research by US scientists, Mr. O’Brien expressed the different challenges faced by researchers, specifically ones that pose a financial and planning burden, like the imposition of fees on mineral, gas, and oil research, as well as on non-commercial research, visa requirements, and custom duties on equipment. He said that on the agency side, the system needs to improve in terms of maintaining awareness throughout the whole process, especially when authorities in charge of the MSR approval process are frequently changed.</p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">The last reactor was Dr. Mohd Uzair who talked about how government agencies hesitate to approve research permits by foreign scientists because they are often seen as “parachute scientists.” He reiterates the importance of building networks among approving agencies, understanding their point of view, and communicating how the MSR will have an economic advantage. </p>

        <p class="atlas-bold location-content3" style="font-size: 20px;" *ngIf="webBool"><br><em>Working towards healthy Philippine seas for future generations of Filipinos</em></p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">The dialogue was organized with the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development in mind. For the past decades, we have been seeing a rapidly changing ocean that is riddled with the long-term effects of climate change and human activity, impacting marine ecosystems, coastlines, and coastal communities. </p>

        <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">Now, more than ever, there is a great need for scientific research to monitor, explain, and understand these changes. The knowledge gained from research can be used to plan nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation and for the sustainable management and conservation of marine resources.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="webBool">The program was closed by UP MSI Director Dr. Laura David. She thanked the speakers for their time and for sharing valuable lessons with other researchers, reminding them that the ocean is a common heritage, therefore everyone will benefit from shared data and collaborative studies. </p>

 <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="ggBool">UP MSI Scientist Dr. Lourdes J. Cruz and fellow conotoxin researchers have been awarded the 2022 Golden Goose Award, a United States award that celebrates the initially dubious research ventures that have turned out to be major breakthroughs. The award was presented by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) during the 11th annual Golden Goose Award ceremony on September 14, 2022.</p>

  <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="ggBool">Another internationally renowned Filipino biochemist, Dr. Baldomero “Toto” Olivera, received the award alongside Dr. Cruz. Other members of the lauded conotoxin team are the late Craig Clark and Dr. Michael McIntosh.</p>

    <p class="subtitle atlas-light location-content4" *ngIf="ggBool"><br>Not just a wild chasee</p>

     <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="ggBool">The Golden Goose Awards has an interesting history. It was conceived as a response to the <em>Golden Fleece Award</em>, which was US Senator William Proxmire’s approach to calling attention to what was deemed ‘superfluous’ or ‘reckless’ spending of government money. It was given 168 times from 1975–1988, subjecting many misunderstood federally-funded scientific projects to undue ridicule.</p>

      <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="ggBool"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130509110813/http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2012/0914golden_goose.shtml" target="_blank" style="color: #384e8a; text-decoration: none;">Nine organizations, including the AAAS</a>, came together in 2012 to present the first set of Golden Goose Awards. Since then, it has recognized 33 major projects in medicine, psychology, the physical sciences, computing, and biology.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="ggBool">Conotoxin research efforts have been funded by the US Department of Defense and National Institutes of Health. The other two recipients of the award this year are the teams behind the Foldscope and bladeless LASIK, respectively.</p>

    <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="ggBool">Conotoxins are a class of neurotoxic compounds isolated from cone snail venom. Intrigued by how the sting selectively affects neuromuscular activity, Dr. Cruz and her colleagues explored its biochemical applications.</p>

   <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="ggBool"> The work began in the 70s when Dr. Cruz was Assistant Professor in the University of the Philippines Manila. Together with Dr. William Gray and Dr. Olivera, Dr. Cruz published a paper on the biochemical characterization of ɑ-conotoxin GI isolated from Conus geographus venom. This 1978 paper was succeeded by publications describing the μ-conotoxins, which block the sodium channels of our tissues.</p>

   <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="ggBool">Since then, research has expanded to include the ω-conotoxins that impede synaptic transmissions, and the conotoxins have been established as reliable reagents for neuroscience and medicine.</p>

    <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="ggBool"> Dr. Cruz’s contributions to biochemistry and biomedical research have earned her many accolades, but her advocacies are what set her apart. For Dr. Cruz, science always had a purpose.</p>

   <p class="atlas-light location-content" *ngIf="ggBool">This recognition serves as encouragement for other Filipino scientists to continue their passionate work in the basic sciences.</p>
