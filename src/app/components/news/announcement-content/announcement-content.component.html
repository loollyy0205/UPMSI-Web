        In keeping with UP’s mandate to serve as a public service university, the UP MSI has been providing various forms of community and public service as well as scholarly and technical assistance to the government, the private sector and civil society. Some projects are aimed at rehabilitating seas and coastal sites in the country, including Manila Bay. Some of these seek to study and conserve the country's lush marine biodiversity, such as the giant clams of the UP MSI's Bolinao Marine Laboratory in Pangasinan <a href="https://www.up.edu.ph/meet-the-giant-clam-fam/" target="_blank">[https://www.up.edu.ph/meet-the-giant-clam-fam/]</a>, and the giant shipworms or tamilok in Sultan Kudarat <a href="https://www.up.edu.ph/from-giant-shipworms-to-biofuels/" target="_blank">[https://www.up.edu.ph/from-giant-shipworms-to-biofuels/]</a>. The UP MSI regularly conducts workshops, local and international conferences, and training courses. It also partners with coastal communities, people’s organizations, non-government organizations, local government units, and national government agencies in projects that directly address local and national needs, with funding from government, private groups or from international sources.

        Some of the UP MSI's initiatives have gained prominence in media. One of these is the exploration of marine life in the West Philippine Sea and Benham Rise, with the UP MSI leading teams of scientists and researchers from various UP units and government agencies such as the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources of the Department of Agriculture and the Biodiversity Management Bureau (BMB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). In addition, the UP MSI is also engaged in many other collaborations with the DENR, including: research into the resilience of fish, coral reefs, and other ecosystems; the development of a management system in key biodiversity areas; coastal land use planning and rehabilitation; and, studies on ocean transport and ecological connectivity. In fact, UP MSI scientists have been presenting the results of their investigations into the West Philippine Sea and the Philippine Rise via the four-episode Philippine Seas: Webinar Series <a href="https://www.up.edu.ph/scientific-findings-on-wps-and-philippine-rise-featured-in-webinar-series/" target="_blank">[https://www.up.edu.ph/scientific-findings-on-wps-and-philippine-rise-featured-in-webinar-series/]</a> of the DENR BMB Facebook page. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denrbiodiversity" target="_blank">[https://www.facebook.com/denrbiodiversity]</a>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" style="line-height: 1.5; margin-top: -2%;" *ngIf="statementBool">Coral restoration is the process of assisting the recovery of a portion of a reef ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged or destroyed (adapted from The Society of Ecological Restoration International). This process involves restoring the coral reef’s ecological structure and functions, as well as its socio-economic benefits. There are 2 important restoration caveats: <em>“(1) coral restoration is always a poor second to the preservation of original habitats; and (2) the use of off-site “restoration” (mitigation) as an equal replacement for habitat and population destruction or degradation is unsupported by empirical scientific evidence, and is at worst an irresponsible degradative force in its own right</em> (Edwards, 2010).”<br></p>

       <p class="atlas-light" style="line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 3.5%;" *ngIf="statementBool">
       The current technologies for coral restoration include: 1) asexual propagation involving coral nurseries and transplantation; 2) sexual propagation involving coral outplanting and coral larval enhancement; and, 3) substratum stabilization or enhancement which includes artificial reefs. Most of these technologies are at the early stages of development and are largely experimental. These technologies have been tested using only about 26 coral species, a mere 6–7% of the coral species that occur in the Philippines. </p>

       <p class="atlas-light" style="line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 3.5%;" *ngIf="statementBool">
       All available coral restoration technologies are limited to very small scales. The restored area of most coral restoration projects worldwide amounts to less than 0.05 hectares (500 square meters). The largest coral restoration projects worldwide range from 1 to 1.5 hectares only (Boström-Einarsson et al. 2020). In the Philippines, the largest ongoing coral restoration experiment that has been published in refereed scientific journals started in 2013 and covers only about 0.01 hectare (dela Cruz and Harrison 2017). It is noteworthy that under the Philippine Republic Act 8550/10654 Section 91.Ban of Coral Exploitation and Exportation, <em>“it shall be unlawful for any person or corporation to gather, possess, sell or export ordinary precious and semi-precious corals, whether raw or in processed form, except for scientific or research purposes.”</em></p>

       <p class="atlas-light" style="line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 3.5%;" *ngIf="statementBool">
       In addition, long term assessments of reefs restored by asexual coral transplantation revealed that although coral transplants survived to a maximum of three years (Cabaitan et al. 2008, dela Cruz et al. 2014), no coral transplants survived after a decade.  For sexual propagation, only a few colonies (<5%) survived 6–12 years after outplanting on degraded reefs (Bonilla et al. 2021).</p>

       <p class="atlas-light" style="line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 3.5%;" *ngIf="statementBool">
        Aside from being an underdeveloped technology, the scale of coral restoration projects is severely limited by the high cost of implementation. The cost of restoring 1 hectare of damaged coral reef can range from US$11,717 to $2,879,773 (or about ₱580,000 to ₱144 million) depending on the technology used and the extent of damage to the reef (Bayraktarov et al. 2016).</p>

       <p class="atlas-light" style="line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 3.5%;" *ngIf="statementBool">
       Hence, current coral restoration technologies cannot be used to rehabilitate, recreate, or replace entire coral reef ecosystems. Coral reefs are far more complex and are many orders of magnitude larger (typically hundreds to thousands of hectares) than what is typically feasible and economically sensible with currently available coral restoration technologies. Coral reefs are geological structures that do not just develop anywhere.  They develop where conditions are right, among which is a stable substrate. If the conditions are right, it would still take several centuries to thousand years to develop a reef.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light" style="line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 3.5%" *ngIf="statementBool">
       To reiterate, <strong>coral restoration technologies are still at the experimental stage and are carried out at small scales, including projects in the Philippines. Thus, results from these efforts are not yet applicable and cannot be recommended for use in large-scale restoration initiatives.</strong></p>

       <p class="atlas-light" style="line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 3.5%;" *ngIf="statementBool">
       This statement is applicable to any conceivable cause of coral reef damage, including ship groundings, storm damage, coral bleaching, and large-scale reclamation.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light" style="line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 3.5%;" *ngIf="statementBool">
      UPMSI has been conducting scientific studies that aim to develop and improve methods that may be used to restore damaged portions of coral reefs. To date, UPMSI has published at least 50 scientific papers and/or manuals on coral restoration in collaboration with world experts from Japan, Singapore, Thailand, USA, Australia, Israel, Mexico, Tanzania, Italy, and the UK.</p>
