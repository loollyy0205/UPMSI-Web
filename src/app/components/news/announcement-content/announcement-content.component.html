        In keeping with UP’s mandate to serve as a public service university, the UP MSI has been providing various forms of community and public service as well as scholarly and technical assistance to the government, the private sector and civil society. Some projects are aimed at rehabilitating seas and coastal sites in the country, including Manila Bay. Some of these seek to study and conserve the country's lush marine biodiversity, such as the giant clams of the UP MSI's Bolinao Marine Laboratory in Pangasinan <a href="https://www.up.edu.ph/meet-the-giant-clam-fam/" target="_blank">[https://www.up.edu.ph/meet-the-giant-clam-fam/]</a>, and the giant shipworms or tamilok in Sultan Kudarat <a href="https://www.up.edu.ph/from-giant-shipworms-to-biofuels/" target="_blank">[https://www.up.edu.ph/from-giant-shipworms-to-biofuels/]</a>. The UP MSI regularly conducts workshops, local and international conferences, and training courses. It also partners with coastal communities, people’s organizations, non-government organizations, local government units, and national government agencies in projects that directly address local and national needs, with funding from government, private groups or from international sources.

        Some of the UP MSI's initiatives have gained prominence in media. One of these is the exploration of marine life in the West Philippine Sea and Benham Rise, with the UP MSI leading teams of scientists and researchers from various UP units and government agencies such as the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources of the Department of Agriculture and the Biodiversity Management Bureau (BMB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). In addition, the UP MSI is also engaged in many other collaborations with the DENR, including: research into the resilience of fish, coral reefs, and other ecosystems; the development of a management system in key biodiversity areas; coastal land use planning and rehabilitation; and, studies on ocean transport and ecological connectivity. In fact, UP MSI scientists have been presenting the results of their investigations into the West Philippine Sea and the Philippine Rise via the four-episode Philippine Seas: Webinar Series <a href="https://www.up.edu.ph/scientific-findings-on-wps-and-philippine-rise-featured-in-webinar-series/" target="_blank">[https://www.up.edu.ph/scientific-findings-on-wps-and-philippine-rise-featured-in-webinar-series/]</a> of the DENR BMB Facebook page. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denrbiodiversity" target="_blank">[https://www.facebook.com/denrbiodiversity]</a>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content" style="line-height: 1.5; margin-top: -2%;" *ngIf="statementBool">Coral restoration is the process of assisting the recovery of a portion of a reef ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged or destroyed (adapted from The Society of Ecological Restoration International). This process involves restoring the coral reef’s ecological structure and functions, as well as its socio-economic benefits. There are 2 important restoration caveats: <em>“(1) coral restoration is always a poor second to the preservation of original habitats; and (2) the use of off-site “restoration” (mitigation) as an equal replacement for habitat and population destruction or degradation is unsupported by empirical scientific evidence, and is at worst an irresponsible degradative force in its own right</em> (Edwards, 2010).”<br></p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="statementBool">
       The current technologies for coral restoration include: 1) asexual propagation involving coral nurseries and transplantation; 2) sexual propagation involving coral outplanting and coral larval enhancement; and, 3) substratum stabilization or enhancement which includes artificial reefs. Most of these technologies are at the early stages of development and are largely experimental. These technologies have been tested using only about 26 coral species, a mere 6–7% of the coral species that occur in the Philippines. </p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="statementBool">
       All available coral restoration technologies are limited to very small scales. The restored area of most coral restoration projects worldwide amounts to less than 0.05 hectares (500 square meters). The largest coral restoration projects worldwide range from 1 to 1.5 hectares only (Boström-Einarsson et al. 2020). In the Philippines, the largest ongoing coral restoration experiment that has been published in refereed scientific journals started in 2013 and covers only about 0.01 hectare (dela Cruz and Harrison 2017). It is noteworthy that under the Philippine Republic Act 8550/10654 Section 91.Ban of Coral Exploitation and Exportation, <em>“it shall be unlawful for any person or corporation to gather, possess, sell or export ordinary precious and semi-precious corals, whether raw or in processed form, except for scientific or research purposes.”</em></p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="statementBool">
       In addition, long term assessments of reefs restored by asexual coral transplantation revealed that although coral transplants survived to a maximum of three years (Cabaitan et al. 2008, dela Cruz et al. 2014), no coral transplants survived after a decade.  For sexual propagation, only a few colonies (<5%) survived 6–12 years after outplanting on degraded reefs (Bonilla et al. 2021).</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="statementBool">
        Aside from being an underdeveloped technology, the scale of coral restoration projects is severely limited by the high cost of implementation. The cost of restoring 1 hectare of damaged coral reef can range from US$11,717 to $2,879,773 (or about ₱580,000 to ₱144 million) depending on the technology used and the extent of damage to the reef (Bayraktarov et al. 2016).</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="statementBool">
       Hence, current coral restoration technologies cannot be used to rehabilitate, recreate, or replace entire coral reef ecosystems. Coral reefs are far more complex and are many orders of magnitude larger (typically hundreds to thousands of hectares) than what is typically feasible and economically sensible with currently available coral restoration technologies. Coral reefs are geological structures that do not just develop anywhere.  They develop where conditions are right, among which is a stable substrate. If the conditions are right, it would still take several centuries to thousand years to develop a reef.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="statementBool">
       To reiterate, <strong>coral restoration technologies are still at the experimental stage and are carried out at small scales, including projects in the Philippines. Thus, results from these efforts are not yet applicable and cannot be recommended for use in large-scale restoration initiatives.</strong></p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="statementBool">
       This statement is applicable to any conceivable cause of coral reef damage, including ship groundings, storm damage, coral bleaching, and large-scale reclamation.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="statementBool">
      UPMSI has been conducting scientific studies that aim to develop and improve methods that may be used to restore damaged portions of coral reefs. To date, UPMSI has published at least 50 scientific papers and/or manuals on coral restoration in collaboration with world experts from Japan, Singapore, Thailand, USA, Australia, Israel, Mexico, Tanzania, Italy, and the UK.</p>

       Seabed magnetite mining threatens Lingayen Gulf. The proposed mining project plans to start in the second half of 2022 and is targeted to last 25 years. The negative impacts on natural resources, coastal communities and their livelihood, and even on tourism may last beyond the life of the project, and could be irreversible. It will only serve the short-term interests of those who will profit from a misguided development that threatens the lifeblood of Pangasinan and La Union.

       Importance of Lingayen Gulf</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="gulfBool">
       The Lingayen Gulf (Gulf) in northwestern Philippines is an embayment with an area of 2,100 square kilometers and spans the coastal provinces of Pangasinan and La Union. It is home to diverse and interconnected ecosystems, where several Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and a National Park have been established. The Gulf generally serves as a major fishing ground for both municipal and commercial fishers, and has an extensive aquaculture industry. Around 40 species including mackerel (alumahan or hasa-hasa), roundscads (galunggong), rabbitfish (barangen) comprise the fish catch in the area <sup>[1,2]</sup>. In 2019 alone, total production from commercial and municipal marine fisheries was at 16,280 metric tons with a value of PhP 1.792 billion recorded for Pangasinan, and 3,602 metric tons worth PhP 458 million for La Union [3]. Grow-out culture of milkfish (bangus) is a successful industry producing 58,273 metric tons in 2019 for both Pangasinan and La Union, worth PhP 6.765 billion <sup>[3]</sup>.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="gulfBool">
       Over 1.2M people live around the municipalities and cities in the coast of the Gulf <sup>[4]</sup>. In 2020, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) registered a total of 47,435 individuals engaged in fisheries and fisheries-related activities in Pangasinan and La Union <sup>[5]</sup>. These include capture fishing, aquaculture, gleaning, fish processing, and other related activities (Figure 1). Given these services, any intense extractive, and manipulative activities in Lingayen Gulf could severely affect the fisheries that thrive on ecosystems in the Gulf as well as the livelihood of fishing families there. </p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="gulfBool">
       Magnetite mining is proposed to start in Lingayen Gulf in mid-2022 by the company Iron Ore, Gold, and Vanadium Resources (Phils.) Inc. The project area will be in Sector II, a major aquaculture center of the Gulf (Figure 2), off the coast of Labrador, Lingayen, Binmaley, San Fabian, and Dagupan City, excluding municipal waters. It covers an estimated 9,252.45 hectares or 92.5 square kilometers. Magnetite is a mineral in black sand and one of the primary ores of Iron, the declared metal of interest. It is used in the manufacture of steel. The proponents claim that magnetite mining will generate revenues and create employment for the local government units (LGU). The technology involves siphoning sediments from the seafloor, and recovery of magnetite through screening and magnetic separation, all of which will be done on board a marine vessel. Waste materials produced after extraction will be discharged back into the sea. </p>

       Effects on benthic community and seafloor</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="gulfBool">
       The proposed offshore mining poses several threats to marine environment and resources and may negatively impact the adjacent coastal communities. Although the project description mentions that the pipe for extraction will be kept close to the seafloor to minimize resuspension of sediments, the activity will still lead to disturbance and potential damage to the seabed and affect associated organisms such as oysters (talaba), scallops (kabibi), and sea cucumbers (balat). This was seen in an offshore mining of placer gold in Alaska that significantly reduced benthic macrofauna such as molluscs and echinoderms <sup>[7]</sup>. And even if recovery of benthic organisms is possible, this will depend on the degree and duration of the sediment alteration <sup>[8]</sup>.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="gulfBool">
       The removal of sediments offshore, will deepen seafloor morphology off the coast. Although the coasts of Labrador, Lingayen, Binmaley, and Dagupan City have been prograding or advancing towards the sea <sup>[9]</sup>, sediment accumulated areas remain low-lying and therefore prone to coastal erosion. Deeper seafloor may produce stronger waves reaching the coast, which could worsen the flooding problem especially during the typhoon season. Hence the coastal area becomes more vulnerable to both man-made and natural disasters. The seabed mining at the toe of deltaic systems of the combined Agno-Dagupan-Bued Patalan Rivers will remove the underwater support framework of the sediment structure. Destabilizing the foundation of these deltaic complexes may induce coastal erosion to coastal areas already prone to this hazard. Increased flooding due to wave inundation and salinization of coastal aquifers can be expected to follow. Moreover, sediment supply to the shore will be reduced if black sand is mined in an area where sediments are moving actively <sup>[10]</sup>.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content3" *ngIf="gulfBool">
       Effects on the water column</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="gulfBool">
       The process of suctioning and discharge of materials close to the seafloor can resuspend bottom sediments. Seafloor sediments in the proposed mining tenements are primarily silt-sized (63 to 4 µm) or have powder-like consistency (Figure 3) <sup>[11]</sup>. The fine particle size will keep the sediments in the water column for longer periods of time compared to coarse sizes. Estimates of settling velocity is 1 cm/s for silt sizes and finer, without other compounding factors. The settling velocity is much slower than current velocities. The seabed sediments when resuspended are likely to remain afloat in the water column. This will cause an increase of turbidity in the water column, which in turn will decrease light penetration and thus reduce photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton resulting in lower primary productivity <sup>[12]</sup>. A decline of the primary producers will affect other members of the food chain and lead to lowered fish production and thus affect the fishing industry. Resuspended sediments can also release organic materials buried on the seafloor and possibly cysts of harmful algal bloom (HAB)-causing organisms. The cysts can initiate toxic blooms that may have devastating impact on wild populations of fish, aquaculture stocks, and other organisms across multiple trophic levels.</p>

       Reworking the sediments will also expose organic matter stored in the sediments to degradation processes that release carbon dioxide and cause lowering of pH (acidification). In addition to organics, iron and other trace metals may also be released once the seafloor is disturbed. This may cause contamination in harvested organisms and make them unfit for human consumption <sup>[13]</sup>.</p>

       Although the proposed mining site is in Sector II of Lingayen Gulf, the resuspended materials can circulate to most of the Gulf <sup>[14]</sup>. Recent surface current circulation models (Figure 4) show recirculation or loops of swirling water (eddy) prevalent inside the Gulf. The counterclockwise eddy formation near the coast during both Habagat and Amihan seasons can enhance transport of suspended sediment away from the project area in Sector II to other parts of the Gulf. With the main current generally flowing westward and weaker flow on the eastern side, two important National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) sites shall be affected: the Hundred Islands National Park on the western side of the Gulf and the Agoo-Damortis Protected Landscape and Seascape on the east (Figure 5) <sup>[15]</sup>. Moreover, suspended sediments from the project area may also threaten the Bolinao-Anda reef complex (BARC) which supports the Lingayen Gulf, one of the important fishing grounds in the country.</p>

       In summary, Lingayen Gulf is a major fishing ground with extensive mariculture activities. The proposed seabed mining threatens the marine environment and resources, and coastal communities of the Gulf. It can affect benthic communities and the seafloor, and impact on quality of water even in areas beyond the project site. </p>

       On his second death anniversary, we honor the man behind the UP Marine Science Institute (UP MSI) by remembering some of his notable contributions to marine science and the country. More than his legendary name that’s well known not only in the Philippines but globally, Dr. Edgardo Gomez’s (EDG) legacies will live on forever in the oceans, the labs, and in the hearts of the people. </p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content3" *ngIf="edgBool">The Man Behind the UP MSI</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="edgBool">
       In 1974, Dr. Gomez founded the Marine Sciences Center of the University of the Philippines. Eventually, it became what UP MSI is today. While it wasn’t easy, the founding director was more than ready to do the work.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="edgBool">
       UP MSI has been recognized as the National Center of Excellence in the Marine Sciences and the first Center of Excellence (COE) in Marine Science under the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). It remains to be the leading institution in the country doing pioneering work in research, training and extension, and education.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="edgBool">
       In 1985, he established the UPMSI-Bolinao Marine Laboratory (BML) in Bolinao, Pangasinan, serving as the institute’s first field and satellite research station. It is where he also established the Giant Clam Nursery as part of efforts to save the gentle giants of the sea and secure their survival in the wild.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="edgBool">
       Once endangered, these giant clams, which are locally known as ‘taklobo’ now exist without threats. Shortly after his death, the giant clam conservation program had already produced 35,000 adults and 11,000 juveniles, many of which have been transported and transplanted in the different parts of the country for restocking.</p>

         <p class="atlas-light location-content3" *ngIf="edgBool">Developing the National Coral Reef Assessment Program</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="edgBool">
      They say, the biggest scientific feats are founded on humble beginnings. When Dr. Gomez led the National Coral Reef Assessment initiative in the 1970s, it was the first of its kind in the world. He and his team of two young researchers worked on it inside the unoccupied greenhouse that was offered by the Zoology department when Dr. Gomez was finding ground upon which to build the UP MSI — then known as the Marine Sciences Center.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="edgBool">
      The National Coral Reef Assessment project mapped and studied the coral resources of our country and helped prioritize research on the conservation of coral reefs. It gained worldwide recognition, inspiring other major conservation projects, like the Global Reefs and Risk Analysis, International Coral Reef Action, and the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network. </p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="edgBool">
      A passionate marine scientist through and through, Dr. Ed consistently championed our sovereign rights in the West Philippine Sea. He spoke in press conferences armed with facts and data that show the negative effects of foreign presence on the health of our marine ecosystems and on our economic productivity. Dr. Ed’s tenacity urged many Philippine leaders to step forward and declare their stand against militarization and other illegal activities in the WPS.</p>

       <p class="atlas-light location-content2" style="line-height: 1.5;" *ngIf="edgBool">
      The same call inspires the current generation of marine scientists in MSI through their initiatives in the WPS. These include the refurbishment and restoration of the Pag-asa Island Research Station, establishment of the National Academic Research Fleet, and continued conduct of marine scientific expedition for surveys and monitoring.</p>

      The UP Marine Science Institute (UP MSI) together with the Foundation for National Interest (FNI) and the Embassy of the United States of America to the Philippines (U.S. Embassy Manila) will be hosting the third and final installment of “Track 1.5 Dialogue on Marine Science Research (MSR): Comparing and Reviewing Approval Process and Framework”, which focuses on Philippine MSR and the West Philippine Sea (WPS). <br> <br>

      Distinguished moderators, plenary speakers, and panel reactors will head three separate panel discussions on important issues regarding the ocean and MSR work. <br> <br>

      The first panel focuses on national challenges involving marine protected areas, fisheries and biodiversity, oceanography, and wildlife trade, while the second panel looks at global challenges, including illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, deep-sea research, marine pollution, and climate change.  <br> <br>

      Lastly,  legal and political perspectives are to be discussed during the third panel to give insights into how laws and policies affect the ocean and MSR. <br> <br>

      This will be a hybrid event with invited on-site participants at the Manila Hotel, while online participation is open to all. For those interested, please register online to join the event on <strong>14 November 2022, Monday, 9:00 AM to 3:30 PM PST</strong> via Zoom: <a href="https://bit.ly/MSR3Reg?fbclid=IwAR1xLvasBldiPNdUYROCJRCvFGFdCg_zqp6VCS9h8g1Gcl1Eu3a9kOypdCg"  style="color: #384e8a;" target="_blank"> bit.ly/MSR3Reg</a>. <br><br>
