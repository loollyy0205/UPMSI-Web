        In keeping with UP’s mandate to serve as a public service university, the UP MSI has been providing various forms of community and public service as well as scholarly and technical assistance to the government, the private sector and civil society. Some projects are aimed at rehabilitating seas and coastal sites in the country, including Manila Bay. Some of these seek to study and conserve the country's lush marine biodiversity, such as the giant clams of the UP MSI's Bolinao Marine Laboratory in Pangasinan <a href="https://www.up.edu.ph/meet-the-giant-clam-fam/" target="_blank">[https://www.up.edu.ph/meet-the-giant-clam-fam/]</a>, and the giant shipworms or tamilok in Sultan Kudarat <a href="https://www.up.edu.ph/from-giant-shipworms-to-biofuels/" target="_blank">[https://www.up.edu.ph/from-giant-shipworms-to-biofuels/]</a>. The UP MSI regularly conducts workshops, local and international conferences, and training courses. It also partners with coastal communities, people’s organizations, non-government organizations, local government units, and national government agencies in projects that directly address local and national needs, with funding from government, private groups or from international sources.

        Some of the UP MSI's initiatives have gained prominence in media. One of these is the exploration of marine life in the West Philippine Sea and Benham Rise, with the UP MSI leading teams of scientists and researchers from various UP units and government agencies such as the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources of the Department of Agriculture and the Biodiversity Management Bureau (BMB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). In addition, the UP MSI is also engaged in many other collaborations with the DENR, including: research into the resilience of fish, coral reefs, and other ecosystems; the development of a management system in key biodiversity areas; coastal land use planning and rehabilitation; and, studies on ocean transport and ecological connectivity. In fact, UP MSI scientists have been presenting the results of their investigations into the West Philippine Sea and the Philippine Rise via the four-episode Philippine Seas: Webinar Series <a href="https://www.up.edu.ph/scientific-findings-on-wps-and-philippine-rise-featured-in-webinar-series/" target="_blank">[https://www.up.edu.ph/scientific-findings-on-wps-and-philippine-rise-featured-in-webinar-series/]</a> of the DENR BMB Facebook page. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denrbiodiversity" target="_blank">[https://www.facebook.com/denrbiodiversity]</a>
