        MSC served as the Universityâ€™s coordinating base for marine research. In
        June of the same year, the first Advisory Executive Council of the Center
        was formed with the appointment of Dr. Edgardo D. Gomez as acting
        Director. The Center commenced its operations in February 1975 at the
        building of the U.P. Natural Sciences Research Institute. With its
        transformation into an institute on 23 April 1985, UPMSI began offering
        graduate programs.

        The UPMSI offers MSc and PhD degrees in Marine Science
        and the Professional Masters in Tropical Marine Ecosystems
        Management (PM-TMEM). Students taking either degree are
        asked to choose to specialize in a specific field, either Marine
        Biology, Marine Physical Science or Marine Biotechnology.
