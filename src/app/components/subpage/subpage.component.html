        <strong class="inter-bold">The UP Marine Science Institute (UPMSI)</strong> is one of seven academic institutes of the University of the
        Philippines’ College of Science. It is housed in its own building complex within the UP Diliman Campus in
        Quezon City. UPMSI was originally established as the Marine Sciences Center (MSC) with the approval of
        its charter by the Board of Regents on 28 March 1974.

      <p class="inter-medium">
        MSC served as the University’s coordinating base for marine research. In June of the same year, the first
        Advisory Executive Council of the Center was formed with the appointment of Dr. Edgardo D. Gomez as
        acting Director. The Center commenced its operations in February 1975 at the building of the U.P. Natural
        Sciences Research Institute. With its transformation into an institute on 23 April 1985, UPMSI began
        offering graduate programs.
