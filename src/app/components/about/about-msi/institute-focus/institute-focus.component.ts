Studying their behaviors and interactions gives plenty of insights into how we can better protect our marine resources. Notable subfields of marine biology are ecology, genetics and genomics, anatomy, and microbiology.`},

Marine chemistry not only helps us understand these changes, but also identify the by-products of human activity that enter the oceans as pollutants. Fundamental research in marine chemistry also allows us to build or improve monitoring and sensing technologies.'},

These properties and processes describe the interaction between water and the atmosphere, the motion of currents, and the evolution of sea ice.'},

Marine geology studies the ocean floor and coastal zone â€” it covers the physical and chemical properties, the sedimentology, and the paleontology of the deepest parts of the ocean. The mysteries and untapped resources of the ocean floor are priority fields in marine science research.'},
