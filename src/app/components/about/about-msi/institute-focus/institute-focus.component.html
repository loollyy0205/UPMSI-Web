    <p class="content-p">MSC served as the Universityâ€™s coordinating base for marine research. In June of the same year, the first Advisory Executive Council of the Center was formed with the appointment of Dr. Edgardo D. Gomez as acting Director. The Center commenced its operations in February 1975 at the building of the U.P. Natural Sciences Research Institute.
